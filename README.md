# Cat Vue
This is pretty much a more complicated "Hello World" app to learn vue.

### Goal
build a vue app to sort/filter some cat pictures and upload more
figure out what I want to accomplish before starting each step rather than cutting corners because of lack of knowledge

### Rules
I can google if something that I think should work doesn't work
Don't look at anyone else's code on GitHub
Limit to Vue documentation and truly understanding the concepts - avoid tutorials unless I'm totally clueless about how to do something


### Questions to research
This is a one-page site. Is it better to use <template> for the innards and have bare bones index.html? 
If so, find out why.


### Phases
1. create HTML page with cat photos and filters (filters don't work)
2. add VueJS
3. Replace HTML elements with Vue directives
4. get the filters to work
5. Add a form to add more data to the page
6. Learn to create Vue filters (needed slugify and unique array items)
7. Learn how to hook up Firebase storage to the app
8. Attempt to upload actual images to Firebase
9. Replace my own data object with jquery ajax consuming an api
